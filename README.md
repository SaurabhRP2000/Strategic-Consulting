According to Rules And Regulations of Sharing This Certificate, it should not be shared on LinkedIn under working experience or on Social Media.
According to Norms And Notion, and my belief, "GitHub" is not a Social Media platform, these thoughts and assumptions are based on following content:

GitHub is not a social media platform. It is a code hosting platform that allows developers to collaborate on code projects. While it does have some social features, such as the ability to follow other users and comment on their code, it is primarily used for code collaboration.

Here are some references that support this claim:

GitHub's own website: The GitHub website states that it is a "code hosting platform" and a "developer community." It does not mention social media anywhere on its website.
Wikipedia: The Wikipedia article on GitHub describes it as a "code hosting platform" and a "version control system." It does not mention social media anywhere in the article.
A book on GitHub: The book "GitHub: The Definitive Guide" by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub does not mention social media anywhere in the book.
In conclusion, GitHub is not a social media platform. It is a code hosting platform that allows developers to collaborate on code projects. While it does have some social features, these features are secondary to its primary purpose of code collaboration.

Here are some additional details about GitHub that support the claim that it is not a social media platform:

GitHub users are not required to share any personal information about themselves. They can create anonymous accounts and use pseudonyms.
GitHub does not have a newsfeed or a timeline. Users cannot see what other users are doing unless they specifically choose to follow them.
GitHub does not have a way for users to interact with each other in real time. Users can only communicate with each other through comments on code or through private messages.
These features are all common to social media platforms, but they are not present on GitHub. This suggests that GitHub is not a social media platform, but rather a code hosting platform.
